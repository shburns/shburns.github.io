# shburns.github.io
Github Pages website for my public account

The primary purpose of this site will be to function as a blog for my technical thoughts and inquiries as well as
to help myself more firmly establish my front-end skills (CSS/HTML, specifically, where my skills tend to break down).

To that end, I am giving myself the constraints of not using any client-side frameworks to enable behavior or assist with
styling and layout control. Ultimately, I hope to have hand-rolled a cross-browser-friendly and (ideally) elegant visual
design to provide simple and stable client-side functionality completely from scratch.

Once thats done and I have a stable and visually appealing platform to blog on, I plan to post to the site with some regularity
on the subjects of my research and inquiries, as well as the progress of my personal development and engineering efforts.
