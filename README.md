# shburns.github.io
Github Pages website for my public account

The primary purpose of this site will be to function as a blog for my technical thoughts and inquiries as well as giving myself an excuse to write a fun little liteweight website without all the bells and whistles that tend to accompany (see: 'bloat') most sites with any sort of dynamic content loading or client-side functionality.

To that end, I am not using any client-side frameworks to enable behavior or assist with styling and layout control. Ultimately, this is supposed to be a hand-rolled cross-browser-friendly site with simple and stable client-side functionality, done completely from scratch.

Once thats done and I have a stable and visually appealing platform to blog on, I plan to post to the site with some regularity on the subjects of my research and inquiries, as well as the progress of my personal development and engineering efforts.
