<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>&emsp;I'm a software engineer based in Richmond, VA. I completed two separate degree programs at Virginia Commonwealth University - Computer Science, and Philosophy - and have been working as an application developer for a small consulting shop in downtown Richmond since my last year of college in 2012. Starting as an intern, I moved to a full-time employee upon finishing school. Now I live and work here with my girlfriend, homebrewing both beer and software solutions and looking after our many pets.</p>
<p>&emsp;Professionally, my work has been mostly web-based and covers a wide range, from the very-front-end to the very-back-end of distributed application architectures, depending on project needs. One of the greatest advantages of working in a consultancy is the change in needs of different projects from client to client. I've gotten a lot of exposure to technologies I might not have seen working in a software shop that focused on one technology stack or suite of tools.</p>
<p>&emsp;I have had lead- or supporting-development responsibilities on a wide range of projects including fully-functional MVC-designed web applications with HTML5/CSS3/JS front-ends, C#.NET or Java middle tiers, and SQLServer, PostgreSQL or Oracle backends; lightweight, client-side only apps that provide interactivity and access to information without deep server-side architecture; and entirely self-contained desktop software solutions.</p>
<p>&emsp;Personally, my development efforts have been focused on learning lower-level programming languages and the optimization techniques necessitated by the constraints of older hardware. I'm convinced this will ultimately make me a better programmer in so far as it helps me to be mindful of how my code will be executed by the hardware that runs it. My interests are predominantly in graphics and simulation programming with a focus on game and graphics engines. While it's been a long time since I've killed a whole afternoon actually <i>playing</i> a game, I will always be fascinated by the engineering challenges unique to, and common within, game development. As such, I've been learning all I can about the development roots of video games and the problem solving approaches others have devised to tackle those unique challenges.</p>
