<h1>On Blogging and Knowledge Transfer.</h1>
<p>&emsp;Having discovered the glorious simplicity of using GitHub's 'Pages' feature to host a webpage from my account, I immediately began thinking about the website I should make. There isn't a whole lot to be done with a simple web page, so there was no real concern over <i>how</i> to write my site. Implementation wasn't the concern. Instead the question was about <i>what</i> to write. With such a wide range of interests, activities, and information, both professional and personal, I was trying to figure out what I should include or exclude. There wasn't anything interesting about the functionality of the site so content was my only concern, and I wanted to have all of the content for the site up at one time. I wanted to start and finish in a single commit, so I thought I needed to sort out the details in one go.</p>
<p>&emsp;That was clearly a mistake. It only took about 30 minutes of mulling that thought over in my head before it occurred to me that the need to have all of the site's content up as soon as the site itself was up was wholly arbitrary. I could post up content as I had it, and leave it at that. Especially since, in all probability, no one will read the content anyway (and if you've made it this far, consider me both surprised and appreciative). Sure, I have some friends that may take an interest in most of the topics I post on, but outside of them, it's unlikely these posts will ever be viewed. I'll put the link on my resume and social network accounts. People will be able to find it if they care to. But that hardly imposes a pressing need for frequent or complete content delivery.</p>
<p>&emsp;So, comfortable in the fact that no one would know or care if I wrote about whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted to write about it, I decided that a simple blog was all I needed. It's still <i>my</i> site, and I want visitors to see who I am and what I'm doing, so I figured I should toss in some informational content with links to what I'm working on and reading at the moment -- some insight into my goals, intentions, etc. Other than that though, I'll just post up blog entries on whatever software-related subject I want to write about whenever the mood strikes.</p>
<p>&emsp;Pragmatism aside, though, I do hope this site becomes useful for someone at some point in the future. As I write about different subjects I'm researching and different challenges I'm approaching, it will be with a small but real hope that someone encounters my post and it saves them some time. Or they read about an area of development I'm learning about and discover it's an area they would like to learn about as well. I'm far from an expert on most subjects, and I doubt anything I write on will be useful for persons already familiar with the subject, but when that's not the case, I hope my writings help. As John Carmack once put it:</p>
<div class="block-quote">Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming.</div>
<p>&emsp;And so I conclude this first post (which was written and published second, but who's counting, right?!) with the hope that, in time, this endeavor helps someone at least once. Meanwhile, I take comfort in the knowledge that even if it doesn't, it at least won't hurt anyone. And so I will continue at my leisure.</p>
